# Chess-Square-Color-Guess
Windows console program. A chess-board coordinate is generated. Guess its color by pressing 1 (black) or 2 (white).  
You can set how many squares you want to practice (e.g. first 3x3 square, first 4x4 etcetera) if you're not ready for all 8x8 yet.

I needed a quick something to practice square color memorization. They say it's a must to know squares by heart. 
Logically deducing the color is not allowed. It must be available from raw memory.
So here I made a quick console app in C to practice colors. Get the executable or compile the code (included) yourself. 
Notice something like this already exists online but now you can choose how many files/ranks you want to practice. For example the first 3 or first 5 ranks+files only. 
It will be obvious what to do. Coded in 15 minutes, so don't expect much - it works.

Yes, you can program it far better than I do. Good for you. Well done.
